# Simulation-Based Planner Agent Pattern

Description: Simulates potential action sequences to pick optimal execution plan.

Value: Optimized planning for logistics, deployments, or decision trees.

## Deliverables

- Simulation loop diagram
- Example using SimPy or custom simulation
- TS + Python examples

## Notes

- Keep simulation deterministic by seeding; measure rollout costs/risks.
