# Agent Marketplace Pattern

## Description

The Agent Marketplace Pattern features a system where agents offer and request services in a marketplace-like environment. Agents can negotiate, bid, or trade tasks based on their expertise, availability, or cost. This pattern enables dynamic task allocation, resource optimization, and competitive collaboration among agents.

### Key Characteristics

- Flexible and adaptive to changing needs

### Limitations
