# Context Engineering Pattern

## Description
Context engineering is the art of structuring, managing, and injecting relevant information into LLMs and agentic systems. It is crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of agents, especially in complex or multi-turn scenarios.

## Why Context Engineering is Important
- Ensures the model has access to all necessary information
- Reduces hallucinations and irrelevant outputs
- Enables memory, retrieval, and dynamic adaptation

## Techniques
- Context windows and chunking
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Memory modules and state management
- Dynamic context injection

## Example
- Using a retrieval system to provide relevant documents to an agent before answering a question.
