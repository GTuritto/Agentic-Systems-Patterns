# Event-Triggered Agent Pattern

Description: Activated only by external events (webhooks, Kafka, Pub/Sub).

Value: Reduces compute usage and latency for real-time tasks.

## Deliverables

- Event-to-action flow diagram
- Kafka/Webhook integration example
- TS + Python implementations

## Notes

- Include signature verification for webhooks; document retry policies.
