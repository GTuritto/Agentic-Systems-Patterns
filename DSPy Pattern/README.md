# DSPy Pattern

## Description
DSPy is a framework for building modular, composable pipelines for LLMs and agentic systems. It enables the design of complex workflows by chaining together reusable modules, supporting both prompt engineering and advanced context management.

## Key Concepts
- **Modules:** Encapsulate LLM calls, tools, or logic as reusable components.
- **Pipelines:** Compose modules into end-to-end workflows.
- **Optimization:** DSPy supports prompt and pipeline optimization for better performance.

## Example Use Cases
- Tool-using agents with modular skills
- Multi-step reasoning and decision-making
- Automated prompt optimization
