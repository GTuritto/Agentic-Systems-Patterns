Description: Detects and recovers from workflow failures by retrying or re-planning.

Value: Improves uptime and fault tolerance.

## Deliverables

- Monitoring + recovery loop diagram
- Example ETL agent with fallback sources
- TS + Python examples

## Notes

- Implement exponential backoff and circuit breakers.
- Distinguish transient vs permanent errors; escalate when needed.
