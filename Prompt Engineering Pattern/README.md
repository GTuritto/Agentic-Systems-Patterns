# Prompt Engineering Pattern

## Description
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing, structuring, and refining prompts to maximize the effectiveness of LLMs and agentic systems. Good prompting is essential for reliable, interpretable, and robust outputs.

## Why Good Prompting Matters
- Reduces ambiguity and errors
- Improves output quality and consistency
- Enables complex behaviors (e.g., tool use, reasoning)

## Best Practices
- Use clear instructions and context
- Provide examples (few-shot prompting)
- Test and iterate on prompts
- Use prompt templates for reusability

## Example
**Bad Prompt:**
> Summarize this.

**Good Prompt:**
> Summarize the following article in 3 bullet points, focusing on key findings and recommendations:
