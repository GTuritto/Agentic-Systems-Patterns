# Consensus-Seeking Multi-Agent System Pattern

Description: Multiple agents propose answers; a meta-agent synthesizes a consensus.

Value: Increases reliability for critical decision-making.

## Deliverables

- Debate + synthesis flow diagram
- TS + Python implementation
- Configurable number of agents and voting strategy

## Notes

- Keep agent independence to reduce correlated failures.
- Provide majority, weighted, and judge-LLM strategies.
